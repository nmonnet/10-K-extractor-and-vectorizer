# 10-K-extractor-and-vectorizer



## Extracting URL and matching with WRDS database

The URL_wrds_matched_extractor.ipynb notebook is designed to retrieve the 10-K reports of all available stocks on WRDS. To run the code, you must have access to a WRDS account. Additionally, it requires a supplementary file that maps ticker symbols to CIK codes. This file can be downloaded from [SEC's Ticker Symbol File ](https://www.sec.gov/include/ticker.txt) and should be placed in a folder named "data." A version acquired on 24/09/2024 is available in the repository.
